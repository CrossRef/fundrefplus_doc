## Overview

The following short examples show how the CrossRef REST API can be used to issue sophisticated queries against the CrossRef system.

## Finding out what is in the CrossRef system

You might start by wondering how much and what kinds of data exist in the CrossRef system.

### How many DOI records does CrossRef have?

    http://api.crossref.org/works?rows=0

### What content types does CrossRef have?

    http://api.crossref.org/types

### How many journal article DOIs does CrossRef have?

    http://api.crossref.org/types/journal-article/works?rows=0

### How many report DOIs does CrossRef have?

    http://api.crossref.org/types/report/works?rows=0

But eventually you will probably want to start looking at metadata records

### Example 1

    TBD

### Example 2

    TBD

And then you will want to start looking for metadata records that contain specific terms

### Example 1

    TDB
   
### Example 2

    TBD

So let's look at specific records

### Example 1

    TBD

### Example 2

    TBD

Interesting. There is license information in there and full text links.
